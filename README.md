## About

Huan (pronounced *WHO - ON*), is a llm based data lifecycle tool

Huan offers three main features

- **DATA COLLECTION**
  - Collect data 
    - from websites
    - from documents (txt, csv, pdf ...)
    - from images
  - Get it in your preferred format (csv, json, txt ...)

- **DATA CLEANING**
  - Remove Data
    - Remove hallucinations
    - Remove Duplicates
    - Remove null data
  - Replace values

- **DATA AUGMENTATION**
  - Transform data
  - Generate accurate synthetic data

## Why?

Data is extremely fluid, often requiring custom code for cleaning and collecting. When large quantities of data are
needed (for tasks such as Machine Learning, data analysis, etc...) this can get out of hand. Alot of single
purpose code ends up being created, fitting the need of that particular data source. We aim to change that by using 
llm's as the engine behind the data lifecycle. Users should be able to collect, clean, and augment their data using just 
a prompt, regardless of the source.

## Build From Source

-----------------
In J.R.R. Tolkien's the Silmarillion, Huan is a 
wolfhound from Valinor. He embarks on various heroic
quests during the life of Beren and Lúthien. Just like 
the Huan of the books, you can employ the huan CLI to
help you with your data quest.
